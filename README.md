> Repository for tensorflow tutorial code

All of the TensorFlow's  tutorial codes that I used to learn about TensorFlow, machine learning (ML) and neural networks can be found here. There is a `README` file accompanying every model that explains nearly what every single line of code in that model does, so if you want to learn about TensorFlow, this is a good place to start. I have also provided references to TensorFlow's docs in the `README` file in each folder.

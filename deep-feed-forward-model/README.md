# TensorFlow Tutorials - Deep Feed Forward Neural Networks

The deep feed forward neural network is similar to the softmax regression model but is composed of more hidden layers. First, let's import TensorFlow and our MNIST data set.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data

# Download and extract the MNIST data set, convert to one-hot
mnist = input_data.read_data_sets("MNIST_data/", one_hot=True)
```

Now we need to define the number of layers and the number of hidden nodes within each hidden layer. 

```python
# Hidden layers
n_nodes_hl1 = 800
n_nodes_hl2 = 800
n_nodes_hl3 = 800
```

You can have as many hidden nodes in each layer as you want, and they don't have to be the same. So the first layer could have `800`, the second could have a `1000` and so on. Now we need to define the number of classes we have and the batch size that we want to train our neural network with for every epoch.

```python
# Classes
n_classes = 10
# Batch size
batch_size = 100
```

The number of classes we have is 10 since we have numbers from `0` to `9`. Our batch size is 100, you can change this to your own preference as well. Now we need to reserve a place in our code for the flattened MNIST images and the labels.

```python
# Variables
# Matrix: height x width
x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, [None, 784])
y = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
```

`x` is a `placeholder` for the flattened images of height `None` and width `784` since the images are 28 pixels by 28 pixels. `y` is a placeholder for our labels. Now let's define the weights and biases for our hidden layers. 

```python
def neural_network_model(data):
    # (input_data * weights) + biases
    hidden_1_layer = {'weights': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([784, n_nodes_hl1])),
                      'biases': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_nodes_hl1]))}

    hidden_2_layer = {'weights': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_nodes_hl1, n_nodes_hl2])),
                      'biases': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_nodes_hl2]))}

    hidden_3_layer = {'weights': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_nodes_hl2, n_nodes_hl3])),
                      'biases': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_nodes_hl3]))}

    output_layer = {'weights': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_nodes_hl3, n_classes])),
                    'biases': tf.Variable(tf.random_normal([n_classes]))}
```

The `weights` are `tf.Variable` whose value is a `tf.random_normal` of shape `[input_node_size, output_node_size]`. `biases` are also `tf.Variable` whose value is a `tf.random_normal` of shape `[number_of_nodes_in_hidden_layer]`. Now let us define each of our layers.

```python
    # Model
    l1 = tf.add(tf.matmul(data, hidden_1_layer['weights']), hidden_1_layer['biases'])
    l1 = tf.nn.relu(l1)

    l2 = tf.add(tf.matmul(l1, hidden_2_layer['weights']), hidden_2_layer['biases'])
    l2 = tf.nn.relu(l2)

    l3 = tf.add(tf.matmul(l2, hidden_3_layer['weights']), hidden_3_layer['biases'])
    l3 = tf.nn.relu(l3)

    output = tf.add(tf.matmul(l3, output_layer['weights']), output_layer['biases'])

    return output
```

For each of our layers, we multiply the incoming `Tensor` with the `weights` of the hidden layer and then add the `biases` of the hidden layer to it. Then we pass the output of each hidden layer to a `tf.nn.relu` activation function which calculates the rectified linear for each layer. As with all of our earlier models, we need to train our model and calculate loss. 

```python
def train_neural_network(x):
    # Feed input to model
    prediction = neural_network_model(x)
    # Cross-entropy
    cost = tf.reduce_mean(tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits(labels=y, logits=prediction))
    # Optimizer (Adam)
    optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(cost)
    # Model will train for 10 cycles, feed forward + backprop
    epochs = 10

    # Session
    with tf.Session() as sess:
        # Initialize global variable
        sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())
        # Run cycles
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            epoch_loss = 0
            for _ in range(int(mnist.train.num_examples / batch_size)):
                epoch_x, epoch_y = mnist.train.next_batch(batch_size)
                _, c = sess.run([optimizer, cost], feed_dict={x: epoch_x, y: epoch_y})
                epoch_loss += c
            print('Epoch', epoch, 'completed out of', epochs, 'loss', epoch_loss)

        # Check prediction
        correct = tf.equal(tf.argmax(prediction, 1), tf.argmax(y, 1))
        accuracy = tf.reduce_mean(tf.cast(correct, tf.float32))
        result = sess.run(accuracy, feed_dict={x: mnist.test.images, y: mnist.test.labels})
        print("{0:f}%".format(result * 100))


train_neural_network(x)
```

We have already discussed the scope and usage of every single line of the function defined above, so there is no need to go through them individually. Running the above model should give you an accuracy of about 95%, reasonably good but not good enough.
